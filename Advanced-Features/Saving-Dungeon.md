# Saving/Loading a Dungeon

:::warning[Caution]

This feature is still experimental and may get broken changes (or being revamped) in future versions of the plugin!\
But you can always use it as a first solution, before trying to implement your own save solution for the dungeon.

:::info[Important Note]

This feature is not an out-of-the-box solution to save/load your game.\
It only handles the dungeon serialization part of your game.\
You will still have to do yourself the serialization of you player character and any actors spawned at runtime.

## Overview

The plugin provides blueprint nodes to your `Dungeon Generator` actors to serialize/deserialize the whole dungeon into a [`Dungeon Save Data`](/api/Structs/DungeonSaveData) structure.
You can then hold this structure into your `Save Game` class to save your dungeon into a save game.

If you are using a C++ archive-based save system, you also have direct access to the functions to save the dungeon in your archive or structured archive directly.

When loading a dungeon, the data is immediately deserialized from the structure, but the

## Saving actors placed in room levels

Any actor placed in a room level can be handled by the dungeon serialization.

:::warning

The actors must be placed in the room levels to be considered by the dungeon serialization!\
The player character or any actor spawned at runtime will not be reached by the dungeon serialization system.
You will have to handle them by yourself.

:::

To be serialized, the actor (or one of its components) must implement the [`Room Actor Guid`](/api/Classes/RoomActorGuid) interface.\
This interface adds 2 new functions to the actor (or component):

- `Get Guid`: Must return a unique Guid in the room (the same guid can be used in multiple room instances, but each guid in the same room must be unique).
- `Should Save Actor`: Must return true if you want the actor to be included in the dungeon serialization process.

The plugin provides a ready to use component called [`Simple Guid`](/api/Classes/SimpleGuidComponent) which provides a guid and implements this interface.\
If you are already using your own guid components in your project, then you just have to implement the interface on them.

Once your actor is available for serialization within the dungeon, you can use the `Save Game` flag of the actor's variables to include these variables in your game save.

You can also implement the [`Dungeon Save`](/api/Classes/DungeonSaveInterface) to get access at some save/load events:

- `Pre Save Dungeon`: event called only when saving a dungeon. It is called on all actors before starting the serialization of the whole dungeon.
- `Post Load Dungeon`: event called only when loading a dungeon. It is called after the dungeon has finished to load.
- `Dungeon Pre Serialize`: event called just before serializing the actor (saving or loading). You may use it to prepare some data before they are saved for example.
- `Dungeon Post Serialize`: event called just after serializing the actor (saving or loading). You may use it to compute/update some other variables after they are loaded for example.

## Saving doors generated by the dungeon

The door actors **spawned by the dungeon** are also handled by the dungeon serialization.\
You can use the `Save Game` flag and the `Dungeon Save` interface like you would do for the actors placed in room levels (see above).\
However, there is not need to implement the `Room Actor Guid` interface on them (unless you want to place some doors in your room levels too).
